        "Financial audits in convention only involve financial statements analysis done by external auditors who must have a sophisticate education background and domain experience. Nevertheless, financial statement audits still require tremendous effort from auditors and leave a loophole for corruption. To alleviate this issue, this project aims at developing a machine learning based model to help auditors detect false accounting. This model will use both financial statements and all other accessible enterprise data, such as sales data, product information and other files generated from the Business Process of the company. "

        "Traditional audits rely on manually check financial statements by an auditor, which has many drawbacks. According to Asare, Wright & Zimbelman (2015), there are 6 major difficulties facing auditors. During the audit process, incentives and opportunities for management are hard to be identified with a fixed audit program. In the aspect of auditors, their lack of experience and too much trust in management will lead to the failing of detection.\n",
        "To address these issues, machine learning techniques are introduced. Sharma & Panigrahi (2013) evaluate 6 classifiers on financial statement fraud detection, which are Multilayer Feed Forward Neural Network (MLFF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Genetic Programming (GP), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Logistic Regression (LR) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Their experiments claim that PNN outperforms others, while GP is the second-best classifier. Another study (Hajek & Henriques 2017) found out that ensemble methods are the best in terms of true positive rate, while Bayesian Belief Networks are the best in true negative rate. However, in consideration of fraud statements can adapt to a fixed predictor, the adaptability of the model is required. Zhou & Kapoor (2011) proposed an evolutionary framework that combines the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with domain knowledge to solve the adaptability issue of the model. \n"

        "Although previous studies adopted many machine learning techniques into fraud detection for financial statements, they only include supervised learning methods, by which fraudulent labels must be known as prior. This condition is unrealistic in a real business environment. For which, this research proposes an unsupervised learning algorithm which will include a criterion called \"originality\". This criterion refers to the trustworthiness of a record which may be calculated by its similarity with other records. The proposed model will give the reliability of all records by reference to both the possibility of fraudulence and originality. In addition, as Asare, Wright & Zimbelman (2015) and Sharma & Panigrahi (2013) admitted, text mining techniques will be future research direction in financial statement fraud detection, this research will include text mining techniques, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, to reinforce the proposed model. This is because the proposed model will include not only financial statements from companies but also other information, such as news reports, sales reports and product information, that relate to the audited companies to enhance the performance of the model. This report believes the proposed m will combine text-mining techniques and previous financial statements analysis methods to archive high detection rates and high adaptability. "
